TidyTuesday repository for exploration of R packages to make more aesthetic plots 

I have done alot of testing of different packages and types of plots scattered within multiple scripts and my R repositoy; this allows the opportuntiy to bring this together in one place and enable easy access to specific types ot plots and techniques which aren't easily searchable. 


* 01 - stacked bar chart with simple css styling utilising ggtext 
* 02 - lollipop and bar chart utilising ggflags and ggimage packages 
* 03 - tbc
